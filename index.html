            <blockquote>
                <p>Hello! My full name is <abbr title="so how could I not go for the 'Kaleb's link' pun right?">Kaleb Stephen Link</abbr>. I grew up on the beautiful Gold Coast in Queensland Australia, then moved to Canada with my family in 2014 to another beautiful coast, Vancouver Island. After living in Campbell River for the next 10 years I decided it was time to finally start the career I've always dreamed of: web development and design! And so that brings us to my website- a culmination of my journey into web development.</p>
